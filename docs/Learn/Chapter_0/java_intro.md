### Choosing a Programming Language
When choosing a programming language for your team, you should choose the language that your team has the most experience and is the most comfortable working in. This experience will make learning programming that much easierâ€”there is much in FRC programming regardless of your language. 

While possible to use Python and C++ to program competition robots, most teams choose to use Java (89.2% in 2025). Python is more beginner-friendly, and C++ is more powerful, but Java provides a good middle ground between performance, capability, and ease of use. 

Furthermore, due to its popularity as a first programming language in high-school curricula (in part through AP CSA), and its widespread online support, Java is a strong choice for most teams and the main language for this guide.


However, for the above reasons, this guide will focus on Java as the primary programming language. In the future, we may look to expand support to C++ and Python, but the guide offers no support for these languages at this time. 

Thus, to begin programming, you must first have a solid background in the Java programming language.


## Learning Java

Cultivating a strong command of Java can be accomplished through a range of publicly available, high-quality learning channels. Whether you favor interactive exercises, comprehensive written guides, or instructor-led video lessons, choose resources that align with your personal learning style. Below is a curated selection to help you begin:

## Core Concepts
!!! Tip
    It isn't necessary to learn all of Java, particularly when it comes to Object-Oriented Programming. Because FRC programming uses of a subset of the language to accomplish most tasks, it is possible to start this course with a very surface level understanding of basic syntax. However, for more advanced behavior and programs, a deeper understanding of Java will become more important. 



To be able to start learning FRC Programming, a strong foundation in programming is necessary. Below is a list of topics that any FRC programmer should know:

- **Variables and Data Types** ([int](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp), [double](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp), [boolean](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_booleans.asp), [String](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_strings.asp))
- **Control Flow** ([if/else](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp), [switch](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_switch.asp), [for loops](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_for_loop.asp)/[while loops](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_while_loop.asp))
- **Methods and Functions** ([declaration](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp), [parameters](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods_param.asp), [return values](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods_param.asp))
- **Object-Oriented Programming** ([classes](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp), [objects](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp), [inheritance](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_inheritance.asp), [polymorphism](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_polymorphism.asp), [encapsulation](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_encapsulation.asp))
- **Collections and Data Structures** ([arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arrays.asp), [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arraylist.asp), [Maps](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp))
- **Functional Interfaces** ([lambda](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_lambda.asp), [suppliers](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_lambda.asp))
