# Command-Based Robot Programming Guide

> **Note:** Much of command-based programming has been extensively documented on the [WPILib Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/). This guide is meant to simplify explanations and provide a step-by-step approach for users creating their first command-based program. For every topic, we will link the relevant WPILib reference documentation.

## 1. Understanding Command-Based Programming

### What is Command-Based Programming?

Command-based programming is a declarative programming paradigm that helps you organize your WPILib project and execute robot code logic in an organized fashion. 

### Why Use Command-Based Programming?

- **Modularity**: Breaks down robot actions into small, reusable commands and subsystems, making code easier to maintain and continously develop over the course of a season.
- **Independent Development**: Allows each subsystem and command to be developed and tested separately, helping teams manage complexity as the robot grows.
- **Supports Parallel and Sequential Actions**: Enables more sophisticated robot behaviors by naturally supporting concurrent and ordered operations.
- **Cleaner Code and Collaboration**: Syphoned abstracted logic between hardware, high level multi mechanism logic and lower level, single mechanism logic leads to "less boilerplate" code.

The command-based pattern is based around two core concepts: **commands** and **subsystems**.

### Key Concepts

**Commands**: Commands represent actions the robot can take. Commands run when scheduled, until they are interrupted or their end condition is met. Commands are very recursively composable: commands can be formatted together to accomplish more-complicated tasks.

**Subsystems**: Subsystems represent independently-controlled collections of robot hardware (such as motor controllers, sensors, pneumatic actuators, etc.) that operate together. Subsystems back the resource-management system of command-based: only one command can use a given subsystem at the same time.

## 2. Setting Up Your Project Structure

### Creating a Command-Based Project

1. **In WPILib Visual Studio Code**:
     - Execute the command "Create a new project"
     - Select "Template" → "java" → "Command Robot"
     - Enter your project information
     - Create the project

> **Note:**  
> There are two different command-based robot project templates available in WPILib: **"Command Robot"** and **"Command Robot Skeleton"**.  
>  
> It is recommended to use the **"Command Robot Skeleton"** template. The skeleton template does **not** include example files, which can sometimes confuse new users. Starting with the skeleton template gives you a cleaner foundation for building your own robot code.

### Project Structure Overview

A standard template for a command-based robot project is included in the WPILib examples repository. The root package/directory generally will contain four classes:

```
src/main/java/frc/robot/
├── Main.java              // Main robot application (don't modify)
├── Robot.java             // Main control flow
├── RobotContainer.java    // Robot setup and bindings
├── Constants.java         // Global constants
├── subsystems/            // All subsystem classes
│   └── IntakeSubsystem.java
└── Class Commands/              // All command classes
      └── RunIntakeCommand.java
```

### Key Files Explained

- **Main.java**: The entry point for your robot program (Java only - don't modify)
- **Robot.java**: Handles the main control flow and periodic updates
- **RobotContainer.java**: Where you define subsystems, commands, and button bindings
- **Constants.java**: Store all your robot's constants in one place

## 3. Setting up a Subsystem

### What Are Subsystems?

Subsystems are the basic unit of robot organization in the command-based paradigm. A subsystem is an abstraction for a collection of robot hardware that operates together as a unit.

> **Tip:**  
> For the purposes of this tutorial, we will begin with a base Intake Roller Subsystem and build our command-based system from there.

### Create a Subsystem

The recommended method to create a subsystem for most users is to subclass the abstract SubsystemBase class. Simply type "extend SubsystemBase" after your class name and add the specified periodic method as shown below.

**Basic Subsystem Structure:**

```java
public class IntakeSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {
      // Hardware components
      private final PWMSparkMax intakeMotor = new PWMSparkMax(Constants.IntakeConstants.INTAKE_MOTOR_PORT);
      
      /** Creates a new IntakeSubsystem. */
      public IntakeSubsystem() {
            // Initialize hardware here
      }
      
      @Override
      public void periodic() {
            // This method is called once per scheduler run
            // Use for continuous monitoring/updates
      }
      
      // Subsystem methods that commands will call
      public void setIntakeSpeed(double speed) {
            intakeMotor.set(speed);
      }
      
      public double getIntakeSpeed() {
            return intakeMotor.get();
      }
      
      public void stopIntake() {
            intakeMotor.set(0);
      }
      
      // Command factory methods
      public Command runIntakeCommand(double speed) {
            return runOnce(() -> setIntakeSpeed(speed));
      }
      
      public Command stopIntakeCommand() {
            return runOnce(this::stopIntake);
      }
}
```

### Subsystem Best Practices

1. **Encapsulation**: Hide hardware details inside the subsystem
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each subsystem should control one functional area (e.g., the intake should only be responsible for intake roller movement)
3. **Provide Clean Interface**: Offer methods that commands can easily use
4. **Use periodic()**: For continuous monitoring and updates

## 4. Setting up Commands

### What Are Commands?

Commands represent actions the robot can take. Commands run when scheduled, until they are interrupted or their end condition is met.

### Command Lifecycle

Every command, including Built-In, factory, and class-types, has four key methods:

1. **initialize()**:  
   Called once when the command starts.  
   *Use this method to set up any initial state, reset sensors, or perform setup actions before the command begins executing.*

2. **execute()**:  
   Called repeatedly while the command runs.  
   *This is where you put the main logic of your command. It runs in a loop until `isFinished()` returns true. If you have a multi subsystem auto aim, state machine, or trajectory that requries constant refreshing of variables, put that logic in execute()*

3. **isFinished()**:  
   Returns true when the command should end.  
   *This method checks if the command’s goal has been met (for example, a timer has expired or a sensor has reached a value). When it returns true, the command will stop executing.*

4. **end()**:  
   Called once when the command finishes.  
   *Use this to clean up or reset anything after the command ends, such as stopping motors or releasing resources. This runs whether the command ends normally or is interrupted.*

### Using Built-in Command Types

The command-based library includes many pre-written command types. Through the use of lambdas, these commands can cover almost all use cases and teams should rarely need to write custom command classes.

### Common Command Types and When to Use Them

Below are the most common command types in WPILib, each with a description and guidance on when to use them:

1. **InstantCommand**
      - **Use when:** You want to perform a quick, one-time action that completes immediately (e.g., stop the intake roller).
      - **Example:**
          ```java
          new InstantCommand(() -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake(), intakeSubsystem);
          ```

2. **RunCommand**
      - **Use when:** You want to run code continuously while the command is scheduled, and stop when it ends (e.g., run the intake while a button is held).
      - **Example:**
          ```java
          new RunCommand(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75), intakeSubsystem);
          ```

3. **StartEndCommand**
      - **Use when:** You need to run code while the command is active, and a different action when it ends (e.g., run the intake on press, stop on release).
      - **Example:**
          ```java
          new StartEndCommand(
                    () -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75),
                    () -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake(),
                    intakeSubsystem
          );
          ```

4. **FunctionalCommand**
      - **Use when:** You want full control over initialization, execution, ending, and completion conditions, but don’t want to write a full class (e.g., run the intake for a certain time).
      - **Example:**
          ```java
          new FunctionalCommand(
                    () -> {}, // initialize
                    () -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75),  // execute
                    interrupted -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake(), // end
                    () -> Timer.getFPGATimestamp() > 2.0, // isFinished (example)
                    intakeSubsystem
          );
          ```

5. **Command Factories (Factory Methods)**
      - **Use when:** You want to quickly create simple commands using static factory methods for common patterns.  
      - **Note:** These factory methods (`runOnce`, `run`, `waitSeconds`, etc.) are only available within a `SubsystemBase` subclass (i.e., inside your subsystem class).
      - **Examples (inside IntakeSubsystem):**
          ```java
          // Inside your IntakeSubsystem class

          // Run the intake once and finish immediately
          public Command startIntakeCommand() {
                return runOnce(() -> setIntakeSpeed(0.75));
          }

          // Run the intake repeatedly until interrupted
          public Command holdIntakeCommand() {
                return run(() -> setIntakeSpeed(0.75));
          }

          // Run until a condition is met (e.g., sensor detects object)
          public Command runIntakeUntilObjectDetectedCommand(Supplier<Boolean> objectDetected) {
                return run(() -> setIntakeSpeed(0.75))
                      .until(objectDetected);
          }

          // Wait for a specified time
          public Command waitTwoSecondsCommand() {
                return waitSeconds(2.0);
          }
          ```

6. **Command Classes (Extending CommandBase)**
      - **Use when:** The command is complex, reused, or needs its own state/fields (e.g., run the intake for a specific duration).
      - **Example:**
          ```java
          public class RunIntakeForTime extends CommandBase {
                    private final IntakeSubsystem intake;
                    private final double duration;
                    private double startTime;

                    public RunIntakeForTime(IntakeSubsystem intake, double duration) {
                           this.intake = intake;
                           this.duration = duration;
                           addRequirements(intake);
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void initialize() {
                           startTime = Timer.getFPGATimestamp();
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void execute() {
                           intake.setIntakeSpeed(0.75);
                    }

                    @Override
                    public boolean isFinished() {
                           return Timer.getFPGATimestamp() - startTime >= duration;
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void end(boolean interrupted) {
                           intake.stopIntake();
                    }
          }
          ```

     > **Note:**  
     > The `wait` command pauses the execution of the command sequence for a specified duration before proceeding to the next command. This is useful for introducing delays between actions or synchronizing with asynchronous events. For example, `waitSeconds(2.0)` will delay the next command by 2 seconds.

     **Example usage:**

     ```java
     // Wait for 2 seconds before running the next command
     Command waitThenRunIntake = new SequentialCommandGroup(
          new WaitCommand(2.0),
          new InstantCommand(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75), intakeSubsystem)
     );
     ```

     You can also use the `waitSeconds` factory method (inside a `SubsystemBase` subclass or with the `Commands` utility):

     ```java
     // Using the factory method for a 1.5 second wait
     Command waitCommand = waitSeconds(1.5);
     ```

     > **Note:**  
     > `WaitCommand` is especially useful in autonomous routines where you need to pause between actions, such as waiting for a mechanism to finish moving before starting the next step.

     For more details, see the [WPILib WaitCommand documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/commands.html#waitcommand).

#### Summary Table

| Command Type      | Use For                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| InstantCommand    | One-shot actions         |
| RunCommand        | Continuous actions       |

## 5. Chaining Commands in Command Compositions

### Building Complex Commands

Individual commands are capable of accomplishing a large variety of robot tasks, but the format can quickly become cumbersome when more advanced functionality requiring extended sequences of robot tasks or coordination of multiple robot subsystems is required. Below are a list of the most useful command chain types that you can implement in your project:

### Sequential Commands

Run commands one after another:

```java
// Using the sequence factory
Command autoSequence = Commands.sequence(
      runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75)),
      waitSeconds(0.5),
      run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.3)).withTimeout(2.0),
      runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake())
);
```

### Parallel Commands

There are three types of parallel compositions, differing based on when the composition finishes:

```java
// All commands must finish
Command parallelAll = Commands.parallel(
      runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75)),
      runOnce(() -> driveSubsystem.arcadeDrive(0.5, 0))
);

// Finish when any command finishes
Command raceGroup = Commands.race(
      run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75)),
      waitSeconds(3.0)
);

// Run commands alongside each other
Command driveAndIntake = Commands.run(() -> driveSubsystem.arcadeDrive(0.5, 0))
      .alongWith(run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.3)));
```

> **Note:**  
> The `Commands.sequence`, `Commands.parallel`, and similar factory methods are convenience wrappers. You can also create command groups directly using classes like `SequentialCommandGroup` or `ParallelCommandGroup`, passing your commands as parameters.

**Example using `ParallelCommandGroup`:**

```java
Command parallelGroup = new ParallelCommandGroup(
      new InstantCommand(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75), intakeSubsystem),
      new InstantCommand(() -> driveSubsystem.arcadeDrive(0.5, 0), driveSubsystem)
);
```

### Other Command Compositions

In addition to `Commands.sequence` and `Commands.parallel`, WPILib provides several other command composition patterns for building complex robot behaviors:

- **race**: Runs multiple commands in parallel, but the group ends as soon as *any* command finishes. Useful for timeouts or interrupting actions.
     ```java
     Commands.race(
               run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75)),
               waitSeconds(3.0)
     );
     ```

- **deadline**: Runs multiple commands in parallel, but the group ends when a designated "deadline" command finishes. All other commands are interrupted at that point.
     ```java
     Commands.deadline(
               waitSeconds(2.0), // deadline command
               run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75))
     );
     ```

- **alongWith**: Runs two commands in parallel, and both must finish for the group to end. This is a convenient way to combine two commands without creating a full parallel group.
     ```java
     Command driveAndIntake = run(() -> driveSubsystem.arcadeDrive(0.5, 0))
               .alongWith(run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.3)));
     ```

- **repeatedly**: Repeats a command indefinitely until interrupted. Useful for continuous actions that should only stop when explicitly canceled.
     ```java
     Command repeatIntake = run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75)).repeatedly();
     ```

- **perpetually**: Similar to `repeatedly`, but the command never finishes on its own and must be interrupted.
     ```java
     Command perpetualIntake = run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75)).perpetually();
     ```

For more details and advanced usage, see the [WPILib Command Compositions documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/command-compositions.html).

> **Tip:**  
> For most use cases, you should primarily use parallel and sequential command compositions to organize your robot's actions. Branch out into other specialized command compositions (such as `race`, `deadline`, `alongWith`, etc.) only when you encounter scenarios that require their unique behaviors. This approach keeps your code simple and maintainable. For example, for the context of your intake subsystem, you can have a sequential command group that turns

## 6. Setting Up RobotContainer

### The RobotContainer Class

RobotContainer is where most of the setup for your command-based robot will take place. In this class, you will define your robot's subsystems and commands, bind those commands to triggering events (such as buttons), and specify which command you will run in your autonomous routine.

### Basic RobotContainer Structure

```java
public class RobotContainer {
      // Subsystems
      private final IntakeSubsystem intakeSubsystem = new IntakeSubsystem();
      private final DriveSubsystem driveSubsystem = new DriveSubsystem();
      
      // Controllers
      private final CommandXboxController driverController = 
            new CommandXboxController(Constants.OIConstants.DRIVER_CONTROLLER_PORT);
      
      public RobotContainer() {
            // Configure default commands
            configureDefaultCommands();
            
            // Configure button bindings
            configureBindings();
      }
      
      private void configureDefaultCommands() {
            // Set default command for drivetrain
            driveSubsystem.setDefaultCommand(
                    run(() -> driveSubsystem.arcadeDrive(
                          -driverController.getLeftY(),
                          -driverController.getRightX()
                    )).withName("Default Drive")
            );
      }
      
      private void configureBindings() {
            // Button bindings go here (See button binding section for more info)

          // Bind A button to start intake at 75% speed while held
          driverController.a().whileTrue(
               run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75))
          );

          // Bind B button to reverse intake at 50% speed while held
          driverController.b().whileTrue(
               run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(-0.5))
          );

          // Bind X button to stop intake when pressed
          driverController.x().onTrue(
               runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake())
          );

      }
      
      public Command getAutonomousCommand() {
            // Return autonomous command
            return null;
      }
}
```
> **Tip:**  
> When writing your RobotContainer class, declare your subsystems at the top of the file, place your button bindings configuration in the middle, and define your autonomous routines at the bottom. This structure keeps your code organized and easy to maintain.

## 7. Binding Commands to Triggers

### Understanding Triggers

Apart from autonomous commands, which are scheduled at the start of the autonomous period, and default commands, which are automatically scheduled whenever their subsystem is not currently in-use, the most common way to run a command is by binding it to a triggering event, such as a button being pressed by a human operator.

### Button Bindings

Command binding is done through the Trigger class. The command-based HID classes contain factory methods returning a Trigger for a given button.

```java
private void configureBindings() {
      // Button press bindings
      driverController.a().onTrue(
            runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75))
      );
      
      // While button is held
      driverController.b().whileTrue(
            run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(0.75))
      );
      
      // When button is released
      driverController.x().onFalse(
            runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake())
      );
      
      // Toggle command
      driverController.y().toggleOnTrue(
            run(() -> intakeSubsystem.setIntakeSpeed(-0.75))
      );
}
```

### Trigger Conditions

You can also bind commands to custom conditions:

```java
// Bind to sensor readings (e.g., object detected)
new Trigger(() -> intakeSubsystem.getIntakeSpeed() > 0.5)
      .onTrue(runOnce(() -> intakeSubsystem.stopIntake()));

// Bind to subsystem conditions
new Trigger(() -> /* some intake condition */ false)
      .onTrue(runOnce(() -> System.out.println("Intake condition met!")));
```

- [Binding Commands to Triggers](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/binding-commands-to-triggers.html)

## 8. The Command Scheduler

### How the Scheduler Works

The CommandScheduler is the class responsible for actually running commands. Each iteration (ordinarily once per 20ms), the scheduler polls all registered buttons, schedules commands for execution, and runs all scheduled commands.

### Scheduler Process

The scheduler follows this process every 20ms:

1. **Poll Triggers**: Check all registered triggers for state changes
2. **Schedule Commands**: Start new commands based on trigger conditions
3. **Run Commands**: Call execute() on all active commands
4. **Check Completion**: Call isFinished() and end() as needed
5. **Resource Management**: Ensure subsystem requirements are respected

### Resource Management

Multiple commands can run concurrently, as long as they do not require the same resources on the robot. Resource management is handled on a per-subsystem basis: commands specify which subsystems they interact with, and the scheduler will ensure that no more more than one command requiring a given subsystem is scheduled at a time.

### Reference material
- [Command Scheduler](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/command-scheduler.html)

## 9. Constants and Organization

### Constants Class

Organize all your robot's constants in one place in a separate class from your subsystem. This declutters your subsystem and command program.

> **Note:**  
> Some teams choose to create a separate `Constants` class for each subsystem (e.g., `DriveConstants`, `IntakeConstants`) instead of grouping all constants in a single file. This can help keep constants closely associated with their respective subsystems and improve maintainability in larger projects.

```java
public final class Constants {
      public static final class DriveConstants {
            public static final int LEFT_MOTOR_PORT = 0;
            public static final int RIGHT_MOTOR_PORT = 1;
            public static final double DRIVE_SPEED = 0.8;
            public static final double TURN_SPEED = 0.6;
      }
      
      public static final class IntakeConstants {
            public static final int INTAKE_MOTOR_PORT = 3;
            public static final double INTAKE_SPEED = 0.75;
      }
      
      public static final class OIConstants {
            public static final int DRIVER_CONTROLLER_PORT = 0;
            public static final int OPERATOR_CONTROLLER_PORT = 1;
      }
}
```

### Project Organization Tips

1. **Group Related Commands**: Create subfolders in the commands directory
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make your intent clear in class and method names
3. **Keep Methods Small**: Break complex operations into smaller, testable pieces
4. **Comment Your Code**: Explain the "why" behind your decisions

## 10. Testing and Debugging

### Testing Individual Components

1. **Test Subsystems**: Use the subsystem's periodic() method for monitoring with Smartdashboard or Advantagekit Logging.
2. **Test Commands**: Run commands individually to verify behavior. Use the printline technique shown below for verifying command functionality

### Common Debugging Techniques

```java
// Add logging to commands
@Override
public void initialize() {
      System.out.println("Command started: " + getName());
}

// Monitor subsystem state
@Override
public void periodic() {
      SmartDashboard.putNumber("Intake Speed", intakeMotor.get());
}
```

## 11. Best Practices Summary

### Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have one clear purpose
2. **Encapsulation**: Hide implementation details within subsystems
3. **Dependency Injection**: Pass subsystems to commands through constructors
4. **Declarative Programming**: Set up behavior once, let the framework handle execution

### Code Organization

1. **Use the Standard Structure**: Follow the WPILib template organization
2. **Keep Constants Organized**: Group related constants together
3. **Write Factory Methods**: Create reusable command factories in subsystems
4. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make your code self-documenting

### Example: Real-World Project Structure (PhantomCatz 2025)

Below is an outline of the `frc/robot` directory from the referenced project:

```
frc/robot/
├── Constants.java
├── Main.java
├── Robot.java
├── RobotContainer.java
├── commands/
│   ├── auto/
│   ├── drive/
│   ├── intake/
│   └── ... (other command groups)
├── subsystems/
│   ├── DriveSubsystem.java
│   ├── IntakeSubsystem.java
│   └── ... (other subsystems)
└── util/
      └── ... (utility classes)
```

**Key Points:**
- Commands are grouped by function (e.g., `auto`, `drive`, `intake`).
- Subsystems are in their own folder.
- Utility code is separated into `lib/util` and `util` folders.
- Core files (`Robot.java`, `RobotContainer.java`, `Constants.java`) are at the root.

This structure helps keep code organized, scalable, and easy to navigate as the robot project grows.

[PhantomCatz 2025 Robot Code](https://github.com/PhantomCatz/RobotCode2025-Reefscape/tree/main/SeasonCode2025/src/main/java/frc/robot)

### Testing Strategy

1. **Test Incrementally**: Build and test one component at a time
2. **Use Default Commands**: Set up safe default behaviors
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider what happens when things go wrong
4. **Log Important Events**: Use console output or SmartDashboard for debugging

## 12. Next Steps

Once you have a basic command-based robot working, consider exploring:

- **Advanced Command Compositions**: More complex parallel and sequential operations
- **PID Control**: Closed-loop control for precise movements
- **Path Following**: Autonomous navigation using trajectory generation
- **State Machines**: Managing complex robot behaviors
- **Custom Triggers**: Creating sophisticated activation conditions

The command-based framework is powerful and flexible. Start with simple commands and subsystems, then gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the paradigm.
