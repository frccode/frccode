# Drive Base in FRC Programming

## Types of Drive Bases
> - **Differential(aka West Coast Drive / Tank Drive)** enables simple maneuverability using two mirrored drivetrains(sets of 2-3 wheels powered by a set of motors and gearboxes) that independently power each side of the drive base. This allows for simple yet effective manuvering with speed differences, strong pushing power, and a ease of control system implementation.

> - **Swerve drive** enables ominidirectional drivebase control, allowing robots drive in ways that typical drivebases cannot do (ie. spin in place, sideways, diagonally, drive while spinning). It has become the dominant drivebase in FRC since 2022–2023, giving teams a significant mobility advantage.

> - **Mecanum drive** is four wheel drive system in which every wheel is a "mecanum wheel"(pictured below).<!-- TODO Add mecanum wheel picture-->
This special wheel enables ominidrectional movement that includes strafing directly sideways or diagonally.

> - **H Drive** is a differential drive with an added fith wheel(usually an omniwheel) at the center of the drivebase. This extra wheel enables sideways strafe motion.

> - **Other Swerve Drives** While the most common FRC drive bases are covered above, there are several other unique or experimental designs used by teams for specific strategic advantages. **Butterfly Drive** and **Octanum Drive** are hybrid systems that allow switching between traction and omnidirectional movement—Butterfly uses omni and traction wheels, while Octanum uses mecanum and traction wheels. **Kiwi Drive** uses three omni wheels in a triangular layout for holonomic movement. **Crab Drive** mounts all wheels on steering modules so the robot can move in any direction without changing orientation, with all wheels turning together. **Ackermann Steering** mimics car-style steering with only the front wheels turning, and is rare in FRC. Teams also sometimes create custom or hybrid drives to meet unique game challenges, combining features from multiple systems or using nonstandard wheel arrangements. These drive bases are less common but demonstrate the creativity and engineering diversity found in FRC.

## Focus of This Guide

This guide will primarily focus on programming swerve drives and tank drives (also known as differential or West Coast drive). These systems are most commonly used in competition due to their versatility, performance, and prevalence in modern FRC games. The following chapters will provide detailed explanations, code examples, and best practices for implementing both swerve and tank drive systems in your robot code.
