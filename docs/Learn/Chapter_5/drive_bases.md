# Drive Base in FRC Programming

## Types of Drive Bases
> - **Differential(aka West Coast Drive / Tank Drive)** enables simple maneuverability using two mirrored drivetrains(sets of 2-3 wheels powered by a set of motors and gearboxes) that independently power each side of the drive base. This allows for simple yet effective manuvering with speed differences, strong pushing power, and a ease of control system implementation.

> - **Swerve drive** enables ominidirectional drivebase control, allowing robots drive in ways that typical drivebases cannot do (ie. spin in place, sideways, diagonally, drive while spinning). It has become the dominant drivebase in FRC since 2022â€“2023, giving teams a significant mobility advantage.

> - **Mecanum drive** is four wheel drive system in which every wheel is a "mecanum wheel"(pictured below).<!-- TODO Add mecanum wheel picture-->
This special wheel enables ominidrectional movement that includes strafing directly sideways or diagonally.

> - **H Drive** is a differential drive with an added fith wheel(usually an omniwheel) at the center of the drivebase. This extra wheel enables sideways strafe motion.

> - **Other Swerve Drives**
