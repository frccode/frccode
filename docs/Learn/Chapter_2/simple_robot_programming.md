# An Intro Through Timed Robot
At this point in the guide, you should have your VSCode and WPILib installed, as well as a fundamental understanding of the Java programming language.

This module will introduce you to many beginner concepts that will be used throughout all of FRC programming using `TimedRobot` as an example. While other robot architectures are more popular and often more powerful, `TimedRobot` serves as an excellent stepping stone to introduce the fundamentals. 

## Introduction to the TimedRobot Template

WPILib provides the `TimedRobot` base class to simplify handling robot periodic actions. A TimedRobot automatically calls key methods at regular intervals (default every 20 milliseconds), allowing you to focus on writing logic rather than managing timing.

### The `TimedRobot` Class

When you create a new robot project in VSCode with WPILib, the generated `Robot.java` will extend `TimedRobot`. This class includes several lifecycle methods that you can implement:

- `robotInit()`: Runs once when the robot code first starts. Use this to initialize sensors, motors, cameras, and other hardware.
- `autonomousInit()`: Called once each time the robot enters Autonomous mode. Reset relevant timers, encoders, or state variables here.
- `autonomousPeriodic()`: Called periodically (every 20ms by default) during Autonomous mode. Place autonomous routines and sensor checks here.
- `teleopInit()`: Called once each time the robot enters Teleoperated (Teleop) mode. Prepare any state for driver control.
- `teleopPeriodic()`: Called periodically during Teleop mode. Read joystick inputs, update motor outputs, and run control loops here.
- `disabledInit()` and `disabledPeriodic()`: Called when the robot is disabled. Useful for stopping motors or updating dashboards safely.

### Basic Project Structure

Hereâ€™s an example skeleton of a `Robot.java` file:

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    @Override
    public void robotInit() {
        // Initialize hardware and state
    }

    @Override
    public void autonomousInit() {
        // Reset sensors or timers before autonomous
    }

    @Override
    public void autonomousPeriodic() {
        // Autonomous control logic
    }

    @Override
    public void teleopInit() {
        // Any setup before teleop
    }

    @Override
    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Driver control code
    }

    @Override
    public void disabledInit() {
        // Actions on disable
    }

    @Override
    public void disabledPeriodic() {
        // Periodic actions when disabled
    }
}
```
